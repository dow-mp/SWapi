# The Beings of Star Wars

## About The Project

### Built With

## Getting Started

View the live [webpage.](https://dow-mp.github.io/SWapi/)

### Prerequisites

You need a web browser to view the website. If you'd like to fork this repo, you can do so by visiting the [repo](https://github.com/dow-mp/SWapi) and clicking on the Fork button under the header at the top right of the page.

## Usage

I am using this project to demonstrate and practice fetching data from an API and displaying the data in a readable format on a web page. You can fork this repo and use it to do the same - or you can use it to check out information on some of the characters from Star Wars.
